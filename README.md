They require 2FA, use an effective escrow, and the admin responds to tickets fast. Both newbies and seasoned buyers are welcome.

## Security Analyst’s Snapshot – “Why These Two Markets?”

From a threat intelligence view, only a few markets remain in 2025 because of increasing law enforcement pressure. **We the North** and **Nexus** make the cut because:
